description: Run the short Spec Kit flow end-to-end (specify → plan → tasks → implement → converge) with a single stop before implementation.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Flag parsing**: extract flags from the user input before using the rest as the feature description:

- `--bypass` — skip the implementation gate ONLY (no stop before implement). It does NOT suppress user questions: every phase still asks the user whatever it needs.
- `--loop` — after implementing, loop implement ↔ converge until converged (max 5 iterations). Without it, converge runs exactly once.
- Everything else in the input is the **feature description** passed to the specify phase. If the description is empty, STOP and ask the user what to build.

## Goal

Execute the complete **short flow** automatically, chaining each Spec Kit phase as soon as the previous one finishes:

1. `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_SPECIFY__` (feature description)
2. `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_PLAN__`
3. `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TASKS__`
4. **Implementation gate** (unless `--bypass`)
5. `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_IMPLEMENT__`
6. `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_CONVERGE__` (once, or looped with `--loop`)

## Execution Steps

Run each phase by **fully following the instructions of the corresponding Spec Kit command** available to you in this project (same commands the user would invoke manually). Do NOT reimplement or shortcut a phase: load that command's instructions and execute them completely, then move on.

### Phase rules (apply to every phase)

- Announce each phase before starting: `▶ Flow [N/6]: <command>`.
- **User questions are NEVER suppressed — in ANY phase, under ANY flag**: if a phase needs a user decision, clarification, or confirmation (per its own instructions), ASK and WAIT for the answer before continuing. Never auto-answer, never assume defaults for something the phase would normally ask about, never skip a question because the flow is "automatic" or because `--bypass` was passed. `--bypass` removes ONLY the implementation gate, nothing else. Automation chains phases; it does not silence questions.
- If a phase FAILS or its output is invalid, STOP the flow, report which phase failed and why, and tell the user how to resume (fix the issue, then re-run the individual command and continue manually, or re-run this flow).
- Do not skip phases. Do not reorder phases.

### 1. Specify

Execute `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_SPECIFY__` with the feature description from the user input.

### 2. Plan

Execute `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_PLAN__`. If the user provided tech-stack guidance in the input, pass it along; otherwise derive sensible choices from the spec and existing codebase, and ask the user if the choice is genuinely ambiguous.

### 3. Tasks

Execute `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TASKS__`. Every task must carry its complete
`[E:cli=...|model=...|effort=...|context=...]` assignment.

### 4. Implementation gate

- If `--bypass` was passed: skip this gate entirely and continue.
- Otherwise **STOP and ask the user for confirmation** before implementing. Show a compact summary:
  - Feature directory and branch
  - Task count by phase and assigned executor
  - Anything flagged during planning
  - The question: "Proceed with implementation? (yes / no / adjust)"
- Only continue after an explicit yes. If the user says no or asks for adjustments, stop the flow and apply what they ask.

### 5. Implement

Execute `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_IMPLEMENT__` (the exact executor recorded in each
task label applies).

### 6. Converge

Execute `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_CONVERGE__`:

- **Without `--loop`**: run converge once and report its result (converged or remaining tasks appended).
- **With `--loop`**: if converge appends new tasks, run `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_IMPLEMENT__` again and then converge again. Repeat until converge reports converged, up to a maximum of **5 iterations**. If still not converged after 5, STOP and report what remains.

## Completion report

At the end, output:

- Phases completed (and iterations used if `--loop`)
- Feature directory, spec/plan/tasks paths
- Implementation summary: tasks completed / total
- Converge status: converged or remaining work
- Suggested next step (review, PR, or re-run with `--loop`)
